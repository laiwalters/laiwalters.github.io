Known fondly as “the land of wood and water,” Jamaica’s forests feature prime hiking and bird watching. History buffs can the heritage sites of Trelawny, while reggae and dancehall fans will love the authentic music clubs of Kingston. Montego Bay is perfect for snorkeling and shopping, while the spas of Ocho Rios can make any stresses melt away.

		<h2>The Culture</h2>

		<p class="subhead">Music</p>
		<div class="rule"></div>

		<p>This is what we’re known for, here in Jamaica. The passionate and infectious sounds of our folk music is almost like the heartbeat of our people. With origins from villages in Africa, where our forefathers mourned the passing of an ancestor, welcomed a son into the family, or celebrated the end of the harvest, folk music has been a big part of our lives.

		<p>Jamaica is, per capita, one of the most musically influential nations in the world. From local sound-system parties to international festivals, beats and bass are always in the background here.</p>

		<p>Music has always been our tool to express ourselves, which is why our beats are full of history and stories of freedom, independence and the current political climate. The fusion of our African and European heritage has produced several forms of music that still thrive in many modern communities.
		</p>

		<p class="pullquote">
		In Jamaica, we’re all about community and working together
