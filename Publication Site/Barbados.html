		<h2>First Glance</h2>

		<p>
		While it's justifiably famed for its fantastic beaches, Barbados is an island that has it all. In addition to fine powdery sand and brilliant turquoise bays, you'll find smashing nightlife, a Unesco World Heritage–listed capital, a beautiful interior dotted with gardens, and wild surf on the lonely east coast, all inhabited by a proud and welcoming populace.

		<h2>The Culture</h2>

		<p class="subhead">History</p>

		<p>The country’s roller-coaster past is writ large in the physical design of its towns and cities. Santo Domingo’s Zona Colonial exudes romance with its beautifully restored monasteries and cobblestone streets along which conquistadors once roamed. The crumbling gingerbread homes of Puerto Plata and Santiago remain from more prosperous eras, and scars from decades of misrule are marked by monuments where today people gather to celebrate. New communities have arisen only a few kilometers from the ruins where Christopher Columbus strode and where the indigenous Taíno people left traces of their presence carved onto rock walls

		<p class="subhead">Food</p>

		<p>When home is a garden island populated by a cultural mélange of Africans, Chinese, Indians, Spanish and English, you should probably expect food to evolve in some interesting ways.

		<h2>Uniqueness</h2>

		<p class="subhead">Architecture</p>

		<p>In addition to an enduring economic and social legacy, the Spanish colonizers left a physical one in the form of early-16th-century churches and buildings. Homes built by beneficiaries of several industrial boom-bust cycles have also had a lasting impact on urban design.</p>

		<p>Zona Colonial Santo Domingo's compact neighborhood of cobblestone streets steeped in history and colonial-era buildings.</p>

		<p>Puerto Plata Elegant, pastel gingerbread Victorian homes around Parque Central.</p>

		<p>Churches From colonial-era gothic to contemporary postindustrial, the cathedral is often a town’s most striking building.</p>


		<p class="subhead">White-Sand Beaches</p>

		<p>Full of breathtaking beaches, from oases of calm to party hotspots, the country’s coastline can satisfy every taste. It is blessed with year-round warm temperatures and waters, so bring a boatload of lotion to avoid sunburn.</p>

		<p>Playa Rincón Three kilometers of tropical paradise with a nearby freshwater stream to wash off the salt water.</p>

		<p>Bahía de Las Águilas This far-flung, hard-to-get-to beach with cacti hugging the cliffs is definitely worth the trip.</p>

		<p>Playa Macao Not far north of Bávaro, a palm-lined beauty, mostly undeveloped but for a surf camp and informal beach shacks.</p>
