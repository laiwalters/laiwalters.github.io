		<h1>The Bahamas</h1>


		<img src="Bahamas IMG 01.jpg">

		<h2>First Glance</h2>

		<p>Renowned as a maritime playground for sun-starved Americans, this stunning string of subtropical islands is so much more than a cruise-ship stopover. Stretched between the depths of the North Atlantic and Florida's eastern coast, the Bahamas comprises more than 700 islands and 2400 cays, most uninhabited, and all fringed by spectacular coral and fathomless ocean trenches. From the grit and bustle of funky Nassau to the vast mangroves of Andros, there's an astonishing array of beaches, reefs, forests and historic towns to be discovered, all within the compass of an hour's flight.</p>

		<p>
		There’s sailing around the Abacos’ history-filled Loyalist Cays. Partying til dawn at Paradise Island’s over-the-top Atlantis resort. Diving the spooky blue holes of Andros. Kayaking the 365 Exuma Cays. Lounging on Eleuthera’s pink-sand beaches. Pondering pirates in Nassau. There’s a Bahamian island to match most every water- and sand-based compulsion, each framed by a backdrop of gorgeous, mesmerizing blue.
