		<h1>Domincan Republic</h1>

		<h2>First Glance</h2>

		<p>
		The Dominican Republic is one of the Caribbean's most geographically diverse countries, with stunning mountain scenery, desert scrublands, evocative colonial architecture and beaches galore.
		</p>

		<h2>About the region</h2>

		<p>
		The social glue of the DR is the all-night merengue that blasts from colmados (combined corner stores and bars), and this is true everywhere from the capital Santo Domingo to crumbling San Pedro de Macoris to Puerto Plata, where waves crash over the Malecón. Dominicans greatly appreciate their down time and really know how to party, as can be seen at Carnival celebrations held throughout the country and at each town's own distinctive fiesta. These events are windows into the culture, so take the chance to join the fun and elaborate feasts.</p>

		<p>Hundreds of kilometers of coastline define the Dominican Republic (DR) – some of it white-sand beaches shaded by rows of palm trees, other parts lined dramatically with rocky cliffs, wind-swept dunes or serene mangrove lagoons. Whether it’s fishing villages with boats moored along the shores, or indulgent tourist playgrounds with aquamarine waters, the sea is the common denominator. Some of the bays and coves where pirates once roamed are the temporary home of thousands of migrating humpback whales, and form part of an extensive network of parks and preserves safeguarding the country’s natural heritage.

		<h2>The Culture</h2>

		<p class="subhead">History</p>
		<div class="rule"></div>

		<p>The country’s roller-coaster past is writ large in the physical design of its towns and cities. Santo Domingo’s Zona Colonial exudes romance with its beautifully restored monasteries and cobblestone streets along which conquistadors once roamed. The crumbling gingerbread homes of Puerto Plata and Santiago remain from more prosperous eras, and scars from decades of misrule are marked by monuments where today people gather to celebrate. New communities have arisen only a few kilometers from the ruins where Christopher Columbus strode and where the indigenous Taíno people left traces of their presence carved onto rock walls

		<p class="subhead">Food</p>
		<div class="rule"></div>

		<p>When home is a garden island populated by a cultural mélange of Africans, Chinese, Indians, Spanish and English, you should probably expect food to evolve in some interesting ways.

		<h2>Scenery</h2>

		<p class="subhead">Architecture</p>
		<div class="rule"></div>

		<p>In addition to an enduring economic and social legacy, the Spanish colonizers left a physical one in the form of early-16th-century churches and buildings. Homes built by beneficiaries of several industrial boom-bust cycles have also had a lasting impact on urban design.</p>

		<p>Zona Colonial Santo Domingo's compact neighborhood of cobblestone streets steeped in history and colonial-era buildings.</p>

		<p>Puerto Plata Elegant, pastel gingerbread Victorian homes around Parque Central.</p>

		<p>Churches From colonial-era gothic to contemporary postindustrial, the cathedral is often a town’s most striking building.</p>


		<p class="subhead">White-Sand Beaches</p>
		<div class="rule"></div>

		<p>Full of breathtaking beaches, from oases of calm to party hotspots, the country’s coastline can satisfy every taste. It is blessed with year-round warm temperatures and waters, so bring a boatload of lotion to avoid sunburn.</p>

		<p>Playa Rincón Three kilometers of tropical paradise with a nearby freshwater stream to wash off the salt water.</p>

		<p>Bahía de Las Águilas This far-flung, hard-to-get-to beach with cacti hugging the cliffs is definitely worth the trip.</p>

		<p>Playa Macao Not far north of Bávaro, a palm-lined beauty, mostly undeveloped but for a surf camp and informal beach shacks.</p>

		<img src="DomincanR IMG 05.jpg">

		<p>Punta Cana Long strand of sand and the epicenter of the all-inclusive resorts.</p>

		<p>Playa Grande Half-moon cove with turquoise water, good surf waves and readily available seafood lunch.</p>

		<p>Playa Limón Three-kilometer-long strip lined with coconut trees, plus wetlands and mangroves nearby.</p>

		<p>Playa Blanca Tens of kilometers of white sand on the northern coast of Isla Beata, part of Parque Nacional Jaragua.</p>
